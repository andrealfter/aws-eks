- Fix S3 lifecycle configuration (add filter blocks)
- Clean up variables and outputs
- Update cost estimates (~$753/month, saved $900/month)
- Add comprehensive documentation (CLAUDE.md)
- Format all Terraform files
- Security improvements: private EKS endpoint, encrypted storage
- Cost optimization: Spot instances (30%), S3 lifecycle policies
- Update README and Makefile

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Removed Aurora PostgreSQL support
- Removed ElastiCache Redis support

The infrastructure is now focused on core EKS functionality with:

- S3 for storage
- Application Load Balancer
- Comprehensive security groups and IAM roles"
